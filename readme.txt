## Hold'em All

Main repository where I am storing most of my projects dedicated to either learning new technologies !

These projects are of smaller scope to enable quicker learning and avoiding getting bogged down in "production" technicalities.


Here you'll find:
- realtime_data_streaming : realtime data streaming project using randomuser.me API to simulate streaming data, fully dockerized from orchestration to computing to storage.
Stack = Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, Postgres, Cassandra

 - next TBD ! :)
